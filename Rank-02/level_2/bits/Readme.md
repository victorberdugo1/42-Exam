This is actually not an exercise but a compositon of 4 different execises with one main checking whether everything is correct.
For me it has been a good exercise to better understanding binaries.

The 4 exercises are:
print_bits
reverse_bits
swap_bits
& as extra: is_power_of_2 which is solved via binaries.

After compiling you will have to execute entering a number.
The output will print first the binaries of the octet , swapped, reversed and original again, followed by a battery of checked numbers (power osf 2) and confirming whether th number entered is or not a binary number.
